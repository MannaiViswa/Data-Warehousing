# Data Warehousing Project

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to design and establish a robust data warehouse using IBM Cloud Db2 Warehouse. This data warehouse will serve as the foundation for bringing together data from various sources to unlock valuable business insights. Our goal is to perform advanced data integration and transformation effortlessly, ultimately empowering data architects to explore, analyze, and deliver actionable data for informed decision-making.

## Project Steps

### Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

#### Problem Definition

The project involves designing and setting up a robust data warehouse using IBM Cloud Db2 Warehouse. The objective is to bring together data from various sources, perform advanced data integration and transformation, and provide data architects with the tools to explore, analyze, and deliver actionable data for informed decision-making. This project encompasses defining the data warehouse structure, integrating data sources, performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and enabling data analysis.

#### Design Thinking

- **Data Warehouse Structure:** Define the schema and structure of the data warehouse to accommodate various data sources.

- **Data Integration:** Identify data sources and design a strategy to integrate data seamlessly into the data warehouse.

- **ETL Processes:** Plan and implement ETL processes to extract, transform, and load data into the warehouse.

- **Data Exploration:** Design queries and analysis techniques to empower data architects to explore and analyze data.

- **Actionable Insights:** Focus on delivering actionable insights by enabling informed decision-making based on data.

### Phase 2: Innovation

Consider incorporating advanced analytics tools or machine learning models for predictive analysis within the data warehouse.

### Phase 3: Development Part 1

Start building the data warehouse using IBM Cloud Db2 Warehouse.

### Phase 4: Development Part 2

Continue building the data warehouse by implementing ETL processes and enabling data exploration.

### Phase 5: Project Documentation & Submission

Document the data warehousing project and prepare it for submission.

#### Documentation

- Outline the project's objective, design thinking process, and development phases.

- Describe the data warehouse structure, data integration strategies, ETL processes, and data exploration techniques.

- Explain how the data warehouse enables data architects to deliver actionable insights.

#### Submission

- Share the GitHub repository link containing the project's code and files.

- Provide instructions on how to deploy and manage the data warehouse using IBM Cloud Db2 Warehouse.

- Write a detailed README file explaining how to navigate the website, update content, and any dependencies.

This structured approach will guide the successful implementation of the data warehousing project, ensuring that it meets its objectives and empowers data-driven decision-making.
