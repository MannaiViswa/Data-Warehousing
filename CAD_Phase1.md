# Project Title: Data Warehousing

## Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Considerations

### Problem Definition

The core objective of this project is to establish a high-performance data warehouse leveraging IBM Cloud Db2 Warehouse. Our primary challenge is to overcome issues related to managing and extracting insights from diverse data sources. Ultimately, we aim to foster data-driven decision-making, leading to enhanced overall performance across various business functions.

### Design Concepts

- **Data Warehouse Structure:** Our data warehouse will feature a multi-tiered architecture designed for efficient data organization. It will include data marts, data staging areas, and data presentation layers, enabling us to accommodate a wide array of data sources. This approach allows for data segregation and optimization based on usage patterns.

- **Data Integration:** Seamless integration of disparate data sources is a crucial aspect of our project. In addition to identifying source structures, we're formulating a comprehensive data integration strategy. This strategy covers data extraction methods, transformation logic, and the scheduling of data refreshes to ensure real-time data availability.

- **ETL Processes:** Data accuracy and consistency are paramount. Our ETL processes involve thorough data cleansing, including duplicate removal, outlier detection, and handling missing values. Advanced transformation logic will harmonize diverse data formats, ensuring data quality.

- **Data Analysis:** Empowering data architects and analysts is pivotal. We're providing a user-friendly interface equipped with a range of data analysis tools. These include pre-defined SQL query templates, data visualization options, and self-service reporting capabilities. This approach simplifies in-depth data exploration and analysis.

- **Business Insights:** Our primary focus is on delivering actionable insights. To achieve this, we're implementing real-time data monitoring and alerting mechanisms. Decision-makers will access dashboards and reports for quick, informed choices. Furthermore, ad-hoc querying capabilities enable dynamic exploration of data from multiple dimensions, supporting on-the-fly decision support.
